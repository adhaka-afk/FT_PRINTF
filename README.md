# FT_PRINTF
Project 2 @42

This project is about recreating the widely-used C function printf ().
You have a terrific chance to develop your programming skills through this activity. It has a medium level of difficulty.
During the creation and execution of this project your head will revolve around the concept of variadic functions, recursion, and various data types.

Moving-image resources that could assist you in the process:

Websites that can assist you with a variety of functions include:

There are quite some restrictions for 42 students to comply with while writing the code but if you're not a 42 student then you're technically not required to adhere to them but for the sake of challenge I would recommend doing the project with the restrictions.
